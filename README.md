[![Mod Build](https://github.com/HubertBDLB/Jobert_Factories/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/HubertBDLB/Jobert_Factories/actions/workflows/build.yml)


A **Java mod** for Mindustry, *created by 2 french men*, that is still very new and in heavy development.

This mod will be developed when we have free time, so development is going to be slow !
